## Notes

- Nordic_RSE conference in October in Oslo
- Intl. RSE Leaders Meeting in June (invitation/application only) for networking
- NFDI: cross-cutting meeting today in Berlin
    - Leipzig paper vs Berlin declaration needed some smoothing
    - Leipzig paper will be edited, formulating less focus points more to the point.
- EOSC Secretariat (consortium):
    - Co-creation funding for new grants, calls: April, May, June
    - Possibly interesting for RSE intl. collab

- Talk "Software Engineering Guidelines at GFZ"
    - CI/CD framework for end-users ("one-click solution")
        - includes HereMaps license checker from Nokia
    - To be published
- Talk "Lean Process Assessment Model"
    - 3 areas: data, software, project management / support
    - ~~SPICE~~ CMMI-based approach
    - CMMI includes different Maturity Levels (1 to 5) with increasing number of required practices
    - Focused on research processes and CRC (=SFB in German) needs
    - The current version of the LPAM is readable and can be commented at https://www.overleaf.com/read/gdcmsdnzgpns
    - The CRC also plans to pursue a similar CI/CD idea, based on [Conquaire](https://conquaire.uni-bielefeld.de/), but this is only loosely connected to the Lean Process Assement Model
- FizzBuzz - Java Metrics Gamer
    - https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition
    - Humorous example for metrics over engineering
    - Maturity Levels
