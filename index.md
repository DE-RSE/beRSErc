# beRSErc - Berlin-Brandenburg RSE regional chapter

Welcome to the website for the **b**erlin-brand**e**nburg **RSE** **r**egional **c**hapter, the - you guessed it - regional chapter of [de-RSE](https://de-rse.org) in Berlin and Brandenburg.

beRSErc is an open group of people from the area who care about research software.

## Inaugural meeting

Our first face-to-face meeting will take place

> Wednesday, **6 November 2019**  
> **20:00**  
> at **Onionspace**  
> Gottschedstr. 4, Aufgang 4  
> 13357 Berlin

The Onionspace team have been nice enough to offer us their room for free, thanks a lot!

We'll have wifi and a projector as well as - probably - a selection of mineral water and mate available for sale.
The space also has a small kitchen w/ microwave that we could use.

Please **bring your own food, drinks** (other than mate and water), **and snacks**!
